## **CodeAlpha Internship Project**

Welcome to my **CodeAlpha Internship Project** repository! This project was developed during my Front End Internship at CodeAlpha, where I had the opportunity to enhance my skills in web development and software engineering.

### **Project Overview**

This repository contains a multi-functional web application built using **React**. The application demonstrates various aspects of modern web development, including interactive user interfaces, responsive design, and efficient state management. It consists of several tasks that showcase different functionalities:

1. **Home Component**:
   - A welcoming homepage featuring a custom-designed header with the "CodeAlpha" logo and a responsive navigation menu. It provides an overview of the application and sets the tone for an engaging user experience.

2. **Task 1 - Image Gallery**:
   - An interactive image gallery that allows users to view a collection of images with "Next" and "Previous" buttons for navigation. The gallery includes sleek animations, hover effects, and a modern design.

3. **Task 2 - Calculator**:
   - A fully functional calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a clear display and responsive keyboard for an intuitive user experience.

4. **Task 3 - Personal Portfolio**:
   - A personal portfolio page designed to showcase my background, education, skills, certifications, professional experience, and extracurricular activities. The portfolio is styled with a fixed maximum width, highlighted headings, and a clean layout for a professional presentation.

5. **Task 4 - Music Player**:
   - A simple music player that allows users to play, pause, and switch between songs. The player includes intuitive controls and a fixed width, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

### **Key Features**
